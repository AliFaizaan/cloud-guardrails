# Installation

* First, clone the repository and run the installation command.

```bash
# Clone the git repository
git clone https://github.com/salesforce/azure-guardrails.git

# Install
make install
```

* Install Terraform if you haven't already. I recommend using [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv), a Terraform version manager:

```bash
brew install tfenv
tfenv install 0.12.28
```

Now you can follow the rest of the tutorial.
